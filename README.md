# EC601-Project1
I found several relevant works on using machine learning (ML) in building architecture, specifically focusing on the design of floor plans, buildings, and room decoration. One notable example is the ArchiGAN project, which leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to assist in architectural design. The system comprises several models, each dedicated to different aspects of building design—floor plan generation, spatial organization, and even furniture layout. By chaining these models, the approach can generate coherent apartment layouts and larger multi-unit buildings, allowing for window placement, room partitioning, and furniture decoration based on specific constraints. The models are trained on a dataset of annotated apartment plans, demonstrating a high level of flexibility in adapting to different architectural challenges and constraints.
Another significant project, Self-Organizing Floor Plans, highlights the use of neural networks and optimization techniques such as NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). This method allows architects to generate and refine floor plans through evolutionary algorithms that optimize the layout for specific design criteria. The method incorporates graph theory and space syntax, enabling efficient spatial configuration.
These technologies aim to assist architects by generating creative, functional designs without replacing human expertise. Instead, they serve as "co-pilots," automating routine tasks and offering solutions that align with user-specified constraints, freeing architects to focus on more complex and creative aspects of design.
In summary, machine learning can indeed be applied to architectural design tasks, from generating floor plans to furnishing rooms. The technology holds potential to streamline the design process, but it still relies heavily on human input and oversight for optimal results.
Training Process:
Data Preparation: The ArchiGAN model begins by assembling a dataset of over 800 annotated apartment floor plans. These floor plans include details such as room boundaries, door and window locations, and furniture placement. These annotated images serve as the input data for training(NVIDIA Developer)(ArchDaily).
GAN Framework: The model employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which consists of two components:
Generator: The generator creates new architectural designs, producing floor plans that resemble those in the dataset.
Discriminator: This component distinguishes between real floor plans from the dataset and the synthetic ones generated by the generator. The discriminator provides feedback to the generator, helping it improve its output over time(ArchDaily).
Feedback Loop: The generator and discriminator engage in a feedback loop. The generator continuously refines its designs based on the discriminator’s feedback, improving the realism and functionality of the generated floor plans. This iterative process allows the GAN to generate increasingly realistic designs over time(ArchDaily).
Multiple Training Stages: The training process is broken down into stages, starting with generating basic room layouts, then refining them to include architectural elements like windows and doors, and finally adding furniture placement. Each stage builds on the previous one to produce more complex designs(NVIDIA Developer).


Review:
I found several examples about machine learning in architect co-pilot, and there is one example called ArchiGAN. ArchiGAN is a project that contains several parts of models, and each model is responsible for one part of the room such as the furniture and floor. The models in it are trained by deep learning. Firstly, researchers selected over 800 plane of apartment to work out a training set. When the planes come in the models, the generator inside work out new planes and will be judged by discriminator. And the discriminator inside will reply the quality of new planes to generator. After training, ArchiGAN is tested to generate planes for users.
